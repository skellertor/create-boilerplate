# :sparkles: Create Boilerplate :sparkles:

**A boilerplate generator for React and Node apps**

:information_source: Project requirements (what it needs to run correctly)
---
> `node >= v6.0.0` , `git`

### :runner: Getting started

1. Install this repo globally with npm. Type the following command in the cli
```bash
$ npm install -g @clipmx/create.boilerplate
```
2. Once you have installed it globally it will be available on the command line by the name `clip-boilerplate`. Type the following command in the cli
```bash
$ clip-boilerplate init
```
3. You will be prompted to enter a project `type`, `name`, `description`, `version`, and `author`. Project type and name are the only 
required fields. After you enter the information into the prompts, a directory will be created with the project name and 
the boilerplate will be cloned into it. All the dependencies will be installed and it will be a new project not connected
to its original git repo.

## :microscope: Troubleshooting

If you have any issues with cloning the repo you should try two things.
1. check to make sure you have the correct permissions
2. Make sure your `commit email address` is set in git. If you have multiple git users, it needs to be your git user that 
you use for work at payclip.  You can find help doing this [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/)
