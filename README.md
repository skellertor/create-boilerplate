:information_source: Project requirements (what it needs to run correctly)
---
> `node >= v6.0.0` , `git`

### :runner: Getting started

1. Install this repo globally with npm. Type the following command in the cli
```bash
$ npm install -g https://github.com/skellertor/create-boilerplate
```
2. Once you have installed it globally it will be available on the command line by the name `generate-boilerplate`. Type the following command in the cli
```bash
$ generate-boilerplate init
```
3. You will be prompted to enter a project `type`, `name`, `description`, `version`, and `author`. Project type and name are the only
required fields. After you enter the information into the prompts, a directory will be created with the project name and
the boilerplate will be cloned into it. All the dependencies will be installed and it will be a new project not connected
to its original git repo.
